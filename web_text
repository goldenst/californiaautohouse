*****  About page ******

California Auto House, an auto repair shop, was founded in 2017 by Pete Moore. Located in Roseville, California Auto House provides quality maintenance and repairs on both foreign and domestic passenger cars and trucks. We work on all makes and models of cars and offer a full range of services, from scheduled maintenance to major repairs and everything in between. Pete’s 17 years of automotive experience both in technical and business management has given him a unique outlook on the industry. Technicians at California Auto House are ASE and I Car certified. 

Automotive service is both a necessity and a significant inconvenience for most people. Vehicle owners are faced with important and costly decisions every time they visit an automotive service facility, and all too often the service recommendations aren’t clearly explained and only align with their best interests, not that of the customer.

At California Auto House, our goal is to provide you excellent service on all your automotive needs. From the day you purchase a vehicle to the day you sell or trade it in, we are your advocate. We take pride in our ability to work with our clients, provide caring service that will be noticeably different from your previous experiences. We serve our customers the same way we would serve our family or close friends. We want to be certain that our services align with your best interest and believe that our customers will become a part of the California Auto House family.

California Auto House is very community-oriented and provide internships through The Met Sacramento High School.
